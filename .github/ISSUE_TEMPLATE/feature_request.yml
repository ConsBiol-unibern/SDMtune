        Thanks for taking the time to file a feature request!
        Please check if the feature request already exists. If this is the case, instead of creating a duplicate request, please give it a thumbs-up reaction.
        If the feature has not yet been filed, then please describe the feature you'd like to see become a part of SDMtune.
