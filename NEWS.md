# SDMtune 1.1.3
Include Java >=8 in system requirements

# SDMtune 1.1.2
* Removed deprecated function `get_tunable_args()`.
* Removed deprecated argument "parallel" form functions.
* Updated citation text

# SDMtune 1.1.1
Main changes:
* New function `checkMaxentInstallation()` to check if Maxent is correctly configured.
* The argument parallel is deprecated and not used anymore. This because it improved computation only for very large datasets and used the superseded package snow.
* The function `get_tunable_args()` has been replaced by `getTunableArgs()` to be consistent with the camel case function naming. At the moment is still possible to use both functions but `get_tunable_args()` will be deprecated in the next release.
* Four new vignette are now available with the package.

Bug fix: `plotPA` function now works also with new version of `ggplot2`.

# SDMtune 1.1.0
Main changes:
* The function `thinData` accept now a matrix or a dataframe with several columns, useful if the users has information related to the coordinates that doesn't want to lose with the thinning procedure.
* The function `plotResponse` plots the response for the full range of presences and backgrounds/absences when only_presence is TRUE, only_presence is unused only to compute the provided function to the range of presence locations when marginal = TRUE

Bug fix:
* Interactive plot of SDMtune objects are again displayed in the RStudio Viewer pane

# SDMtune 1.0.1
Bug fixes:
* Fix CRAN errors
* Fix bug introduced with version 1.0.0

# SDMtune 1.0.0
Main changes:
* In this release all deprecated functions and functions' arguments have been removed, including the functions to convert old objects (created with version < 0.2.0.) into the new format.
* Add function `addSamplesToBg` to add presence locations to background location.
* `extra_args` in Maxent models cannot be changed anymore.

Bug fix: Fix CRAN error for r-oldrel

# SDMtune 0.2.1
Main changes:
* New function to predict `SDMmodelCV` objects
* Add the possibility to pass multiple methods to the `train` function
* Add possibility to compute the testing AUC or TSS for a held apart testing dataset in the case of a `SDMmodelCV` object
* Add the possibility to merge only the presence locations in the `mergeSWD` function

Bug fixes:
* `plotPA` function now works also with large raster objects 
* Removed font family from plot functions to avoid errors when the font is not available

# SDMtune 0.2.0
This release is the first step to enable more methods to train models. The main change is that the `SDW` object now bundles together the presence and the absence/background locations and is not necessary anymore to pass the presence and absence locations as separate arguments to the `train` function.

Old objects of class `SWD`, `SDMmodel`, `SDMmodelCV` and `SDMtune` created with version <= 0.1.1 must be converted into the new format using the dedicated help functions. Please check the article [Deprecated objects](https://consbiol-unibern.github.io/SDMtune/articles/articles/deprecated-objects.html) in the package website.  

Main changes:
* The `SWD` object bundles together the presence and absence/background locations
* New methods to train models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Random Forest (RF)
* Enabled spatial cross validation: the function `train` accepts now folds partition generated with other packages (i.e. ENMeval and blockCV)
* Add title argument in `plot` function for `SDMtune` objects
* New randomly generated dataset `virtualSp` with presence, absence and background locations
* Number of background locations cannot be tuned anymore using the tuning functions

Deprecated function: `getSubsample`

# SDMtune 0.1.1
* Fix bug in `VarImp` function for `SDMmodelCV` objects
* Real-time charts are now displayed also when R is not executed from RStudio
* `maxentVarImp` function available for `SDMmodelCV` objects

# SDMtune 0.1.0
* First release
