@article{Phillips2006,
abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed pres-ence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

@article{Fielding1997,
abstract = {Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of prediction errors. These may be of two types: false posi-tives and false negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological processes such as unsatu-rated habitat and species interactions. Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological context the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are seldom used by ecol-ogists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are described. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen recommendations are made to enable the objective selection of an error assessment technique for ecological presence/absence models.},

abstract = {The areas beneath the relative (or receiver) operating characteristics (ROC) and relative operating levels (ROL) curves can be used as summary measures of forecast quality, but statistical signi cance tests for these areas are conducted infrequently in the atmospheric sciences. A development of signal-detection theory, the ROC curve has been widely applied in the medical and psychology  elds where signi cance tests and relationships to other common statistical methods have been established and described. This valuable literature appears to be largely unknown to the atmospheric sciences where applications of ROC and related techniques are becoming more common. This paper presents a survey of that literature with a focus on the interpretation of the ROC area in the  eld of forecast veri cation. We extend these foundations to demonstrate that similar principles can be applied to the interpretation and signi cance testing of the ROL area. It is shown that the ROC area is equivalent to the Mann–Whitney U-statistic testing the signi cance of forecast event probabilities for cases where events actually occurred with those where events did not occur. A similar derivation shows that the ROL area is equivalent to the Mann–Whitney U-statistic testing the magnitude of events with respect to whether or not an event has been forecast. Because the Mann–Whitney U-statistic follows a known probability distribution, under certain assumptions it can be used to de ne the statistical signi cance of ROC and ROL areas and for comparing the areas of competing forecasts. For large samples the signi cance of either measure can be accurately assessed using a normal-distribution approximation.},

@article{Phillips2017a,
abstract = {This software note announces a new open‐source release of the Maxent software for modeling species distributions from occurrence records and environmental data, and describes a new R package for fitting such models. The new release (ver. 3.4.0) will be hosted online by the American Museum of Natural History, along with future versions. It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log‐log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently‐published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance. With these two open‐source developments, we invite others to freely use and contribute to the software.},
